#     "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu",
#     "tooltip", "notification", "combo", and "dnd".
#
# following per window-type options are available: ::
#
#   fade, shadow:::
#     controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
#
#   opacity:::
#     controls default opacity of the window type.
#
#   focus:::
#     controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused.
#     (by default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on.)
#
#   full-shadow:::
#     controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window that you
#     normally won't be able to see. useful when the window has parts of it
#     transparent, and you want shadows in those areas.
#
#   clip-shadow-above:::
#     controls whether shadows that would have been drawn above the window should
#     be clipped. useful for dock windows that should have no shadow painted on top.
#
#   redir-ignore:::
#     Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen to become
#     redirected again after been unredirected. If you have unredir-if-possible
#     set, and doesn't want certain window to cause unnecessary screen redirection,
#     you can set this to `true`.
